//It takes one hour and fifteen minutes to complete a racing circuit if the short cut is not taken. If the short cut is taken the circuit can be completed in less than half hour. In the current race short cuts are not allowed.
//You have to write a program that detects if the driver has taken a short cut or not. Your program will take the time input in hours, minutes and. Output should be 1 if he has taken a shortcut.
